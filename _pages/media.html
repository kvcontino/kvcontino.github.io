title: Media Audit 
---

<p>This exercise takes inspiration <a href=https://the-curious-citizen.com/media-checkup-2022/>from elsewhere</a>: <i>"Periodic checkups at the doctor or dentist are a routine part of maintaining physical health. I posit that periodic checkups on our media consumption can be equally important for intellectual health."</i></p>

<p>Writing this is for reflection. Recording this is for accountability.</p>



<p>Current Intake</p>

<p><i>Top few sources for each category</i></p>

<p>Newspapers:</p>

<ul>
<li>News & Citizen</li>


<li>Seven Days</li>


<li>VT Digger</li>


<li>Wall Street Journal</li>


<li>Financial Times</li>


<li>New York Times</li>
</ul>



<p>Newspapers have always been my preferred source of coverage, especially locally. To the extent that local journalism continues to exist, it dominates this category. News & Citizen appears in my mailbox every couple of weeks and provides some sense of what is happening in Lamoille County. Seven Days still bills itself as Vermont's "independent alt-weekly," but with the decline of newspapers throughout the state, it's not clear that it remains an alternative to anything particular. In any event, they have a real newsroom, as does the online-only Digger. Both remain my preferred sources for state-level news coverage.</p>

<p>The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> is the only news source beyond the state level on this section of my list. It's not a regular read, but it's my first choice to get a sense of what is in the national news. The <i>Financial Times</i> or the <i>New York Times</i> are my first choices for international coverage.</p>

<p>I ignore the opinion/editorial pages in all of these publications. At most, I'll scan through the headlines occasionally for the sake of monitoring the "party line." </p>


<p>Blogs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cop in the Hood / Quality Policing</li>

<li>Don't Worry About the Vase</li>

<li>Garbage Day</li>

<li>ribbonfarm</li>

<li>The Future, Now and Then</li>

<li>Calculated Risk</li>

<li>The Money Illusion</li>

<li>Never Met A Science</li>

<li>Just the social facts, ma'am</li>

<li>David Heinemeier Hansson</li>
</ul>


<p>This category includes newsletters and any other kind of writing that I follow by RSS. While I continue to follow some generalists, like Tyler Cowen, Helen Lewis, and Scott Alexander, lately my preference skews more toward writers who focus on a narrower sphere of expertise. The ideal blogger is one who hesitates to opine in public on subjects outside their focus, and whose other writing vehicle is books or academic articles rather than tweets. </p>

<p>This is also a high-churn category for me. I'll often follow a blog for a few months to get a sense of the author's perspective or fill out my knowledge of a topic in which I've taken an interest. An advantage of this approach is that it keeps the regular reading manageable. I can always return to someone if I'm curious about what they are saying or have said about something in particular. The selection that I've listed here reflects a mix of fleeting and long-term interests.</p>


<p>

<p>Podcasts:</p>



<ul>
<li>Decoding the Gurus</li>


<li>Very Bad Wizards</li>


<li>Moody's Talks: Inside Economics</li>


<li>Geopolitics Decanted</li>
</ul>



<p>This is another high-churn category. It's also where I'm most likely to seek out opinions. A long podcast featuring a couple of disagreeing voices that I know well, like Matt Lewis and Bill Scher on The DMZ, or Robert Wright and Mickey Kaus on Blogging Heads, is more interesting than either written editorials (which are leading and predictable) or disagreement expressed over social media (which lacks focus). There's no need for the goofy stuffiness of a formal debate. There's just a lot to be gained from listening to a couple of knowledgeable people talk through their disagreements for forty minutes or more.</p>



<p>Books:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization (Senge)</li>
<li>Nixon Agonistes: The Crisis of the Self-Made Man (Wills)</li>
<li>The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge</li>
<li>Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made (Genovese)</li>
<li>Cyberia (Rushkoff)</li>
</ul>



<p>Senge was wasted on me in grad school. Cyberia was a wild step back into the techno-optimism of the early nineties. Everything else on this list is even older. Then again, other types of media are very caught up in the present. It's rare for a book to feel timeless, but it's the best way to get a sense of how people were thinking in the past. Other forms of media offer too many distractions and not enough focus, and they're not even an option for understanding most historical settings. But even when other choices exist, nothing offers what a book does - the opportunity to follow another person's thoughts, at length, exactly as they chose to record them for you.</p>



<p>Most Influential Voices:</p>



<ul>
<li>Jason Furman</li>



<li>Larry Summers</li>



<li>Michael Kofman</li>



<li>Simon Rosenberg</li>


</ul>



<p>Others more economically literate than I can debate whether Furman and Summers were truly prescient, but no one did more to help me anticipate and understand the economic changes of the past year. Michael Kofman has been the single most informative source of commentary on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic political consultant, was one of the loudest and most persuasive critics of the pre-election consensus that Republicans were likely to capture sizable Congressional majorities. He wasn't just someone who ridiculed Republicans for nominating weak candidates, either. His critique is in the details: Polling averages that included methodologically sloppy polls, obvious indications that Republicans were running poorly managed and under-resourced campaigns, substantial evidence that abortion was weighing on Republican popularity in a way that policy changes rarely fall on parties that hold neither executive power nor legislative majorities.  </p>



<p>GOALS FOR 2023</p>

<ol>
<li>Read more books, both old and new</li>



<li>Avoid algorithmic recommendations and content created to appeal to them</li>



<li>Focus on what I wwant to see more of - avoid gawking at attention-seeking behavior</li>

</ol>
