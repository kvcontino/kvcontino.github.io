    <b>Summary</b><br>
  I have worked as a data analyst in the health care sector since 2015. Before that I studied in geography as an undergraduate (SUNY Geneseo, 2012) and policy analysis at the graduate level (SUNY Albany, 2015). <br><br>I enjoy cartography, statistics, and hiking. I also like to read about philosophy, demography, social theory, and history. Prior to this year, I had been a lifelong resident of various corners of Upstate New York, but I now live in Vermont.
