Almost no one takes the idea of addressing the non-medical determinants of health as seriously as they should.

That is the central lesson of research in population health, going back to the British physician-demographer Thomas McKeown. Medical interventions, from primary care to chronic treatment, explain only a minority of the modern improvement in human lifespans and well-being that populations in the world’s richest countries have experienced since industrialization.

Even the significant achievements of public health, especially life-saving measures like vaccinations, are not the primary reason why our health has improved and our lives have lengthened over the past two centuries. 

What, then, explains most of this change? The answer is improved nutrition. Between 1800 and 1940, the United States experienced a demographic transition as its economy moved from small-scale and slave-based agriculture to mass production. And, in the US and elsewhere, the industrial era was the first time since the Neolithic Revolution when most ordinary people reliably had food and essential nutrients in sufficient quantities to remain healthy.

The United States, with its vast and largely untapped natural wealth, was a well-fed country even before industrialization, compared to its contemporaries, but measures of caloric intake and hunger tend to under-represent improvements in diet quality.

It was a declining birth rate that really secured these gains. Agricultural surplusus could have enabled families to raise more children, but people in industrialized, urbanized countries eventually chose to have fewer of them. 

In comparison, primary care and hospitals had much smaller effects on length of life and overall well-being. These amenities were barely available to most people until decades after the bulk of this demographic transition had taken place, and well into the nineteenth century professional medicine often caused more harm than benefit.

Medical care was far from irrelevant, but much of its importance as a driver of better health outcomes lies in a single sub-field: Reproductive health. Childbirth has been a leading cause of death for women - healthy women, in the prime years of their adult lives - for the whole of human history. This has been true in every kind of society. Historical rates of maternal and infant mortality alike are around 100 times higher than those measured in wealthy countries today.

Nutrition is only one of the non-medical influences on health. Others include the physical environment, social connectedness, and cultural practices. These factors shape human health through the foods that we choose to eat (and how we choose to eat them), the kinds of physical activity that are in our routine, the risky activities in which we indulge, and the relationships on which we build our lives.

***

If you live in a rich, industrialized country and want to be a healthy person, here a few guidelines:

1. *Eat less food than most of the people around you do.*
2. *Don't smoke. Don't drink alcohol heavily or in binges.*
3. *Have active but low-risk hobbies.*
4. *Avoid drugs, including the legal ones.*
5. *Walk frequently. Ideally as a matter of routine.*
6. *Have a clear sense of purpose.*
7. *Have a place in some kind of community.*
8. *Build close, supportive relationships.*
9. *Watch as little television as possible. (Apply this rule to all passive forms of electronic media.)*

Most of us cannot make these adjustments easily. The conditions and behaviors that enable good health are cumulative and interrelated. They assume a great deal about a person’s resources and capabilities. How many of us choose the community into which we are born? How much do we deliberate over our habits and the values?

***

Non-medical influences on health are least effective at improving health outcomes when addressed piecemeal. Interventions need to be complete to have sustained and positive effects. For example, cheap and healthful foods are unlikely to help someone who does not know how to prepare them or who lacks access to a kitchen, to say nothing of someone who does not really believe that improving their eating habits is worthwhile in the first place.

Population health improvement cannot comprise only interventions targeted toward the margins, like 500 healthful meals served at the local kitchen or 2,000 miles walked by local employees of the ABC International Chemical Conglomerate during its spring fitness challenge. However good they make participants feel about themselves, these are not sustained and meaningful changes to patterns of living.

No, an entire way of life is up for indictment. And this is not limited to only the poorest and most marginal. This is the challenge of population health: Where do we begin? How can we persuade ourselves to make such fundamental changes — both individually and collectively — for the sake of our health and well-being?

One source of encouragement: These values and practices have been with us for a long time, and even form the basis for much of human culture. 

But, to varying degrees, we have lost our grip on these traditions, or we fail to take them seriously, or we fail to understand them. Many are de-contextualized from our day-to-day existence that they might seem irrelevant or impractical in guiding us toward a better life in our urbanized, industrialized, and commodified society where mass media are the dominant authority and consumerism is the leading source of shared values.

Another lesson is the limits of clinical medicine. All of us are better off with access to health care, but we should understand the limits of what it can achieve and what we ought to ask of it.

Clinicians can do a great deal, but there is much that they cannot do. A doctor cannot move an obese person’s home to a more walkable neighborhood, reduce the working hours of an adult who smokes to cope with the stress of holding several precarious part-time jobs, force a lonely person’s relatives to spend time visiting, or build a house free of mold for an asthmatic child.

Medicine provides essential support for living a long and healthy life, but it cannot be its source.

For most of us, hospitals and clinics are places through which we pass. We live our lives elsewhere — in our homes, neighborhoods, workplaces, schools, places of worship, bars, shops, restaurants, and so on. Whether our lives are long and healthy reflects the character of these settings, what we do there, and how we relate to the people with whom we share them.
